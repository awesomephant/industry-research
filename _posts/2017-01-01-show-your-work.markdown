Nice short book on self-promotion by artist Austin Kleon. I particularly like the bit about sharing other people's work but only if you know how to properly credit them - good place to draw a line.

Also the section on thinking about the process rather than the end product really speaks to me. Always be documenting and all of that.

> Traditionally, we’ve been trained to regard the creative process as something that should be kept to ourselves. We’re supposed to toil in secrecy, keeping our ideas and our work under lock and key, waiting until we have a magnificent product to show before we try to connect with others. But human beings are interested in other human beings and what other human beings do. By sharing our process, we allow for the possibility of people having an ongoing connection with us and our work, which helps us move more of our product.

Love the non-bullshit attitude about moving product - nothing romantic about being poor.
