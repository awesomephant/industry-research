Some good insights into how political science and data is used to run political campaigns in the US. Graphic design is a part of this: In one section Eisenberg describes an experiment where letters asking people to go out and vote on election day were sent to different groups of people. Each group got a letter with identical content but different graphic treatment - the one that looked as if it was typed up in Microsoft Word and came in a plain white envelope performed the best, far ahead of the glossy, colour-printed "designer's" version.

However the more interesting part to me is the way data science is used to build models that can predict how each individual person is likely going to vote - and what issues might be used to change their behaviour. Applied science is awesome.
