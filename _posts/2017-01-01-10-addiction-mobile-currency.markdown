Some interesting thoughts on how things we see as sort of abstract design goals ("User Retention", "Conversion Rate", "Re-Engagement") aren't necessarily good for people. Making descisions based on metrics is great, but we must'nt forget that behind those numbers are real people with real lives. Goes into Mike Monteiro's ["How Designers Destroyed the World"](https://vimeo.com/122022963) talk to some extent.

This quote gives a pretty poignant summary:

> Venture-backed Social Media companies gave way to Free to Play (F2P) games. F2P games prey on our addiction by offering in-app purchases when our dopamine levels begin to dip. Our industry began talking about “drug dealer models” under the moniker “gamification”. Facebook and FarmVille symbiotically depended on and profited from our addictive nature.
