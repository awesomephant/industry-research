The first time I became aware of the Lufthansa graphic identity was at [The Ulm Model at Raven Row](http://www.ravenrow.org/exhibition/the_ulm_model/) - They had a display with [some of the original applications](https://www.instagram.com/p/BL6CxCQjcGq/?taken-by=maxakohler) and it's gorgeous. I've been trying to find a scan of the 1962 brand guidelines but it doesn't seem to exist. The closest I could get is the reprint that is part of this book, but the small format doesn't really help much. 

As for the rest of the book it always amazes me how huge companies would comission independent designers, or in this case art students to do major work for them (see Paul Rand - IBM). Today they probably pay 7 different ad agencies and have a 50 person in-house team - different times I guess.
