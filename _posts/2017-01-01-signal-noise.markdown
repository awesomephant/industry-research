First learned about Nate Silver through [Fivethirtyeight](http://www.fivethirtyeight.com) coverage of the US presidential election (their model had Trump at 30%, which turned out to be accurate). They also make [a great podcast](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/fivethirtyeight-podcasts/). I read this directly after Sasha Eisenberg's book, which is quite a good package. In this Silver lays out how data science and statistical methods is used in loads of different aspects of life - obvious stuff like weather forecasting and medicine, but also areas like sports and political campaigning.

In general I love the idea of making descisions based on hard science rather than intuition - People at GDS are doing this in a way, using government data to inform design descisions but also working as designers to make data more accessible. Here's some [lecture notes on this](http://www.maxkoehler.com/notes/2016/11/29/designing-with-data-notes.html).
