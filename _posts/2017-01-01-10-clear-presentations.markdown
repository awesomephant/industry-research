Some good practical guidance on making a good presentation from the people at GDS. (I love the fact that GDS make everything public, in other organisations this sort of information would be buried in some internal wiki.)

On preparing for a talk:

> The three things you should be asking yourself as you prepare are: 
    What is the main point I want to make?
    What else does this particular audience need to know to understand that point?
    What is the best order for those things?

On making good slides:

> The typical GDS slide is designed to;
    be easy to read (even at the back of a large room, or on a small screen)
    keep the emphasis on the speaker
    force the writer to be extremely clear about what they’re saying

I like that they're putting emphasis on only presenting information when that's the best way to deliver it - i.e. when something should be printed out and put on a wall, don't make it a presentation.

> We’ve all sat through the presentation that ought to be a table emailed to the finance team. Or been shown the complex user journey that ought to be printed out on a wall. Or asked to approve copy on a slide that should, instead, have been emailed. It’s tedious. So we’ve deliberately constructed a template that forces the writer to think of the presentation as a thing they’ll be presenting.
